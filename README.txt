Made three files one of each HTML CSS and JavaScript

In HTML file named index.txt. Started with making the navbar which will contain the"Logo" "Menu", "Reward" and "Gift car"d on the left side and "Marker signature" , 
"find the store", "sign in" and "join" button. 
These options will shink into a new window if seen in mobile layout. Its a button represent with three lines having classs name "hamburger". 
With the help of the JavaScript and CSS I rotated the top and bottom line along X and Y axix by 45degrees positivily and negatively respectively. 
We can see the beautification in style.css file under the comment section  "Mobile menu" and "hamburger".

Then we'll be moving towards our first block i.e. "1st box" it simply contains a h2 heading formate text along followed with the a small paragraph and a "Learn More" link.
For beautification we have altered the fonts using open sans and the background-color has been set to the #006241 i.e. the default green shade of starbucks and 
as we'll be using it often so we have saved this color in a variable named --color-primary.
We can see that the baackground color of 1st, 4th and second child of the 5th box is same. So it'll be convinient for us to save the colors in a variable.
Same goes for --color-secondary we have given it code of red and for any extra portion have used --color-extra i.e. white.

3rd and 5th box have the same boxing formate of text being on the left side and image on the right.
So we created a class grid reversed where we have where the first child i.e. the image will be pushed to the right side using "order function" we can see this under 
"Grid section" in css file.

Now 6th box is unique because it has 2 sub divisions in a single box.

Then the last part is the footer section which has the link in image formate for all the social hadels of starbucks and its Copywrite.

The buttons are sub catogorized as two the "Sign in" , "Join" and "Order Now" button. 
Sign in                  Join                              Order Now
Black Text             White Text                          White text 
Black Outline          No Outline                        White Outline
White Background    Black Backgroung         Background same as the box's background
Which when hovered upon reacts respectively.

The appearence of the above boxes depends on the size of the window we are looking on. To make sure that the layout is maintained we have made three media blocks 
which controls the reslution size of the boxes , icons and the text placement.
